# Project

A project is the basic container for a website analysis. You can think of it as a folder. An analysis is started on a project, and the next analysis started on this project will have its results automatically compared to the previous analysis' results. Analyses can scheduled within a project.

Through the API, project management is quite limited for now. We are planning to allow you to launch crawls and modify your project settings. A complete list of operations can be found in the **[[reference;reference#/Project]]**.
