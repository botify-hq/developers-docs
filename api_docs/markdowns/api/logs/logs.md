# Logs

Botify Log Analyzer allows you to measure and understand how Google and other bots crawl your website by computing day by day the number of crawls and visits by page. Those metrics enable you to know which parts of your website Google knows about and which it is interested in. And optimize your website by making search engines focus on your strategic pages and react quickly when errors occurs.

Botify Logs API allow you to **get daily crawl and visit metrics** on your website, as long as aggregated metrics on a given period of time. A complete list of operations can be found in the **[[reference;reference#/Logs]]**.

- [[Get summary;logs-get-summary]]
- [[Aggregate URLs data;logs-aggregate-urls]]
- [[List and filter URLs;logs-list-urls]]
- [[Create CSV Exports;logs-csv-export]]
