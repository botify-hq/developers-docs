# Integrations

We provide integrations that allow you to view Botify data in situ, wherever you might need it.

## [[Google Sheets Addon;integrations-google-sheets]]

**Botify for Google Sheets** allows you to easily get Botify data in your Google sheets spreadsheets.
Note that, currently only a small subset of the API is supported by this addon.
Check the documentation, the source code and issue tracker on [Github](https://github.com/botify-labs/botify-integration-google-sheets). Feel free to customize our macros or contributing to the project.

**Botify CMS Embed** allows you to easily get Botify data for a URL inside your Content Management System.
Empower your content editors to have their content's SEO information right inside their content editing views.
