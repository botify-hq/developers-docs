# Rate Limit

To prevent excessive usage of the Botify API and ensure its availability, we set up an API Rate Limit.

## Limits

- **50 calls by minute**.

Once the limit is reached, the API responds with a **[429 HTTP Code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#section-4)** until the limit reason no longer applies.


## Need more?

If you need the limit to be raised, feel free to contact us at [support@botify.com](mailto:support@botify.com).
