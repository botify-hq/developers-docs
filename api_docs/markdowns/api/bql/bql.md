# Botify Query Language

Botify Query Language (BQL) simplifies the interaction between API users and Botify backend systems by providing an intermediate abstraction. It also facilitates the evolution of our data system since it helps decouple the API and the backends.

BQL provides the following abilities on a per-URL basis on the analysis dataset:
  - Retrieve data fields
  - Filtering URL documents based on data fields
  - Sorting on retrieved results
  - Aggregation and nested-aggregation
  - Data models introspection
